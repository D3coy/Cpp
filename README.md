# basic_cpp
 Here are my test programs while I was studying c++

• file_rw - program that writes text to a file and reads it.

• if_f - branching of conditions 

• 2_func - interrelation of functions

• func_overload - overloading 2 functions by passing different arguments

• ref_ptr - refference and pointer
